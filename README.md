<br>

## Getting Started

* We combine Domain Mixup strategy with a classical adversarial domain adaptation method, [RevGrad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7495v2), to showcase its effectiveness on boosting feature alignment. Details are presented in the [Mixup_RevGrad](https://github.com/ChrisAllenMing/Mixup_for_UDA/tree/master/Mixup_RevGrad) folder.
* The proposed DM-ADA approach utilizes a VAE-GAN based framework and performs Domain Mixup on both pixel and feature level. Details are presented in the [DM-ADA](https://github.com/ChrisAllenMing/Mixup_for_UDA/tree/master/DM-ADA) folder. Some typical generations from source, target and mixup features are as follows (VisDA-2017 dataset is employed).
